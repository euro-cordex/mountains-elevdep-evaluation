# Mountains-elevdep-evaluation

Mountains-elevdep evaluation of the CMIP6 downscaling within EURO-CORDEX.

This repository is intended to centralize the coordination of the Mountains-elevdep evaluation study, as part of the broader ([EURO-CORDEX joint evaluation effort](https://github.com/euro-cordex/joint-evaluation)).

The repo is under construction. If you have any topics, questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open a new issue!

There is also a repository ([evaltools](https://github.com/euro-cordex/evaltools)) that might hold useful code used in the evaluation analysis. This is separated for better maintainability.

Details on data exchange and available datasets is available from the ([joint evaluation github landing page](https://github.com/euro-cordex/joint-evaluation)). Data storage and analysis is on the jsc-cordex data exchange infrastructure at ([JSC](https://github.com/euro-cordex/jsc-cordex)).
